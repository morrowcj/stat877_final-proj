# Introduction
<!-- clear statement of problem(s) being addressed, why doing so is 
interesting/important, -->

Plant-insect interactions have traditionally been viewed through the lens of 
single species interactions (one plant and one insect) or interactions between 
whole communities. In particular, the effects of interspecific variation 
have been a focal point of community ecology in general (Power et al 1996)
and in studies of plant-insect interactions. However, the contribution of 
intraspecific variation was largely ignored. In recent decades, more attention 
has been given to the effects that variation in individual species can have on 
entire associated communities (Des Roches et al 2017; Koricheva and Hayes 2018)
and a recent meta-analysis showed that intraspecific trait variation
contributed significantly (25%,on average) to plant community trait variation 
world-wide (Siefert et al 2015). 

The interest in single-species effects on communities led to the development of 
a new field of study: community genetics. Proposed by Antonovics (1992), 
community genetics explores the effects of intraspecific variation on 
communities. This approach provides a means to understanding plant-insect 
interactions more completely than historical approaches. Research in this 
field has determined that different plant genotypes can have a strong 
influence on the composition and diversity of associated insect communities
by way of phenotypic trait expression (Whitham et al 2003, 2008; 
Wimp et al 2005; Bangert et al 2008; Meneses et al 2012; Gosney et al 2017).
**However, specific phenotypic traits, and suites thereof, that most influence 
insect communities remain poorly understood.** Even relatively simple insect 
communities, with only a few constituent taxa, are likely impacted by many host
plant traits. Yet most plant-insect community genetics studies focus on only 
genotype differences and broad-sense heritability of communities without 
investigating the mechanisms that drive those differences. Studies in which
phenotypic trait data have been collected have considered only a few traits,
leaving an incomplete understanding of the complete phenotypic mechanisms 
through which genetic differences act on communities (Hersch-Green et al 
2011; Crutsinger 2016).

To address phenotypic mechanisms of genotype-based community effects, we propose
to evaluate the combined effects that plant genetics and traits have in 
shaping associated insect herbivore communities, using a *Populus* 
experimental system. To this end, we will use a model-based approach to test 
the collective effects of (1) *Populus tremuloides* (aspen) genotype at various 
SNPs, (2) various aspen traits including size and defense traits, and (3) 
various environmental factors including weather and time on the abundance of 
18 common insect species.

## Community genetics: state of the field

The success of herbivorous insects is largely determined by physical and 
chemical characteristics of their host plants, many of which are genetically 
mediated (heritable). Even before the advent of community genetics, 
ecologists recognized that species genetics can influence communities. 
These effects were termed extended phenotypes (EP) (Dawkins 1982; 
Antonovics 1992), a term that is still used by community genetics 
investigators (Whitham et al 2003). Though plant genes do affect insect 
communities, they do not do so directly as in typical phenotypic expression. 
Instead, communities respond to plant phenotypes that are mediated by genes.
Phenotypic traits, then, are the mechanisms of community genetic 
effects (Hersch-Green et al 2011; Crutsinger 2016).

Additionally, expression of individual traits can be constrained by other 
traits. High levels of expression in one trait can predispose a plant to low 
expression of a different trait. Co-expression of chemical defense and growth, 
for example, are limited by allocational and genetic costs (Sampedro 2014; 
Eichenberg et al 2015; ZÃ¼st and Agrawal 2017). Therefore, the interaction of 
heritable plant traits, in addition to individual traits, may be key to 
shaping insect communities.

Many studies have shown genotype-mediated  differences among plant-associated
insect communities (Whitham et al 2003; Johnson and Agrawal 2005; 
Bangert et al 2006; Wimp et al 2010) but few have incorporated genetics and
phenotypic expression to do so. Fewer still have used a wide range of
naturally co-occurring genotypes and respective phenotypic variation. Studies 
meeting these criteria are needed to understand the capacity of a natural 
system for community genetic effects (Crutsinger 2016). Additionally, 
specific plant phenotypes and genotypes to which insect communities are most 
sensitive have not been investigated thoroughly in a community genetics 
context (with notable exceptions for phenotypes such as chemical defenses: see 
Gosney et al, 2017) (Hersch-Green et al 2011; Crutsinger 2016). Chemical, 
physical, and phenological plant traits, the genetic information that regulates
these traits, and their interactions, all influence the structure and 
composition of associated insect communities. It is, therefore, important 
to investigate the effects of multiple plant traits with high levels of 
intraspecific variation. Furthermore, it is important to study plants from a 
population of genetically variable and naturally co-occurring genets of a 
foundation species such as aspen.

## Data Collection

## Statistical Analyses

We will use quantitative-trait genome wide association (GWA) methods to assess 
the effects of aspen genotype, at $114,420$ SNP locations, on 18 herbivorous 
insect species. Best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) of each trait will be 
calculated for each genotype using generalized liner mixed effects models 
(GLMMs). These BLUPs will then be used as the quantitative trait covariates 
in the association regression analysis. Additionally,

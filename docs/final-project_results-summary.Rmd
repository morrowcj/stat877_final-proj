## Methods
```{r}
SNP.N <- nrow(q.df) # 114420
insect.n <- nrow(sig.n.table) # 18
tree.n <- length(unique(tree.traits$SerialNo)) # 1569
genet.n <- length(unique(tree.traits$Genet)) # 437
av.rep <- round(sum(tree.traits %>% group_by(Genet) %>% tally() %>% 
                      transmute(n/4))/genet.n) # 3
```

We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis between trembling aspen 
(*Populus tremuloides*) and incidence (presence/absence) of `r insect.n` common
insects (**table 1**). Incidence was measured on `r tree.n` trees twice per summer 
(June and August) in 2016 and 2017 for a total of 4 surveys events. Among these 
trees, there are `r genet.n` unique individuals (genets), each with an average
of `r av.rep` clonal replicates. 

The DNA reads of each tree were alligned to scaffold regoions of the reference 
genome. Genomomic position relationships among and within chromosomes is 
currently unknown for aspen. Therefore, locations of SNPs are only understood 
within scaffolds. 
For this reason, SNPs were not pruned upstream for LD. Genes and 
annotations for *Populus trichocarpa* and "*Arabidopsis* can be imputed to 
a list of SNPs to draw conclusions about phenotype.

*Ting-Fung: This section is probably better suited for you: 

* GLMM method information here ... followed by model. Maybe something like:

$$logit(p_{i}) = \beta_0 +\alpha SNP + \beta_{m}T_{m} + \epsilon_{k,l} + e$$

Where $i$ is the insect species, $T_m$ is aspen trait $m$ (Volume, PGsum, 
CTsum, etc...) $\epsilon_{k,l}$ is the random effect for genet $k$ in survey
event $l$.

We then converted our p values into q values (Storey), controlling 
for a false discovery rate of .05. Then, for discovery purposes, we use a .05 
significance level cutoff for q values to identify significant associations.

## Results

### Significant Associations

```{r}
snps.n = length(running.sig.snps)
scaff.n = length(running.sig.scaf)
```

From the `r SNP.N` total SNPs, we identified `r snps.n` unique SNPs with 
significant associations ($q < .05$) to incidence of at least one of our 
common insect species. Those SNPs were located on a total of `r scaff.n` 
scaffolds. **table 1** shows the breakdown of significant associations by all 
of our common insect species.

# species$Binomial <- gsub(species$Binomial, pattern = "\\d",replacement = "")
# species
sig.n.table <- cbind("insect description" = insect.description, sig.n.table)
rownames(sig.n.table) <- gsub(rownames(sig.n.table),pattern = "Blackmine",
                              replacement = "Blackmine Beetle")
```


```{r table 1 snp.n, fig.cap = caption}
caption = c("**table 1:** insect descriptions, number of significant SNP associations per insect, and number of scaffolds on which those SNPs are located.")
knitr::kable(sig.n.table, caption = caption)
```

```{r sig n by insects}
ins.n = sum(sig.n.table$SNPs > 0) # 8
common.ins.n <- (unlist(snp.insects) %>% unique %>% length()) # 5
common.n <- nrow(incommon.snps) # 84
common.3.n <- nrow(incommon.snps %>% filter(n.assoc > 2)) # 4
```

Of the `r insect.n` common insects, `r ins.n` had significant associations.
Among those significant associations, `r common.n` SNPs were significantly 
associated with at least 2 insects (**figure 1**). Because we are interested the effects of
the aspen genome on insect communities, these `r common.n` SNPs with shared 
significance will our SNPs of interest. These insects are expected to affected 
by similar mechanisms, due to their similar feeding strategies (**table 1**). 
Therefore, it is more likely that those SNPs that affect multiple insects are 
truly biologically significant. There is especially strong evidence for 
`r common.3.n` SNPs which were associated with 3 insect species and are located
in the same genomic region. This indicates that a true loci of interest lies
wthin this genomic region.

knitr::include_graphics("../figures/gg-multiManhattanPlot.png")
caption <- c(paste("Manhattan-style plots of 5 insects that share",
             "significant SNPs. The x-axis shows a filtered genomic region;", 
             "only scaffolds with shared-significant SNPs (red) are shown.",
             "q value based LOD scores are shown on the y-axis with dashed",
             "lines representing significance levels of .05 (dark blue) and",
             ".01 (blue). When an insect has a red SNP above the .05",
             "line, it shares this SNP association with another insect.",
             "Note that adjacent scaffolds on the x-axis (alternating black",
             "and grey) do not correspond to adjacent regions in the genome.",
             "Exact locations of scaffolds in the genome are currently unkown."
             ))
```
